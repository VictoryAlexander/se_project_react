# Getting Started with What to Wear App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This app uses a weather API that displays weather forecast based on location of the user. Users can add their personal clothing in the form of display cards. The app then filters out clothes based on weather conditions and recommends what the user should wear.
